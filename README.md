# FoundationModelsProject2
RNN, LSTM, and Transformer implementations using PyTorch and BPE SentencePiece tokenizer, all trained on public domain literature from Project Gutenberg

Evaluation metrics include Perplexity and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy scoring. 

The train_rnn.py, train_lstm.py, and train_transformer.py scripts each fully train and evaluate the a model of the type listed in the script name.
